# A Machine Learning Approach to Early Psychosis Detection

Early detection of psychosis can greatly reduce the negative impact a psychotic disorder can have on a patientâ€™s life. If left untreated, an initial psychotic episode can lead to irreparable cognitive deterioration, gray matter atrophy, and further psychotic episodes later in life (McClellan, 2004). Psychosis is typically preceded by a prodromal phase characterized by social and cognitive deficits, which can be identified before the onset of positive psychotic symptoms (McCutcheon, 2020; Fitzgerald, 2004). However, premorbid and prodromal symptoms can be easily confused for indicators of other psychiatric disorders that appear during adolescence or missed altogether (Woodberry, 2016). Predictive machine learning may offer an avenue for objectively evaluating key indicators of a psychosis high risk state, possibly allowing for future clinical application.

This paper explores the predictive ability of several supervised machine learning models to determine which participants in the ABCD dataset are likely to present signs of early onset psychosis based on their performance on the ABCD cogntive test battery. The models are provided with fMRI beta weights collected during tests administered in the scanner and behavioral data from tasks administered inside and outside of the scanner. Additional analyses considering the impact of environmental factors are conducted as well.
