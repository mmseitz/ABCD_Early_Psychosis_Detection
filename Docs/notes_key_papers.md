### Family History and mean PQ-BC endorsement and distress correlations

(Karcher et al., 2018)
- Family history of psychotic disorder in first degree relatives was associated with higher mean PQ-BC total and distress, whereas a family history of depression or mania was not
- Higher PQ-BC scores were associated with neuropsychological test performance deficits such as working memory, motor and speech developmental milestone delays (particularly motor and speech devleopment) as well as KSADS internalizing composite
- PLE persistence over time is associated with greater odds of developing a psychotic disorder in adulthood

(Karcher et al., 2021)
- Brain volume associated with environmmental risk factors and PLEs
- PLEs associated with urbanicity, deprivation, and toxins
- Parental PLEs measured in Achenbach Self Report
- study examined (parcellated cortical and subcortical Desikan regions) intracranial volume, total cortical brain volume, total subcortical gray matter volume, total surface area, total cortical thickness, and hippocampal volume due to the wealth of research linking hippocampal volume to both environmental risk factors and PLEs
- Associations between PLEs and environmental risk factors: greater total drug offense exposure and less perception of neighborhood safety were associated with greater PLEs; greater deprivation and fewer years in current residence were associated with greater PLEs; lead exposure was the only environmental toxin associated with greater PLEs
- Each of the structural MRI variables (except hippocampal volume) were signifiicantly associated with PLEs. These structural MRI variables were also associated with all of the environmental risk factors that were significantly associated with PLEs including neighborhood safety, all deprivation indices, and lead exposure risk
- some evidence consistent with brain volume partially mediating the association between deprivation (both rate of poverty and overall deprivation), perceptions of neighborhood safety, and lead exposure risk with PLEs

### Cognition and Psychosis

(Sheffield et al., 2018)
- not a sympotm of psychotic disorders, but cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of illnesses that include psychotic symptoms
- cognitive impairment is a main contributor to impairment in psychotic disorders
- understanding the timing, specificity, and severity of cognitive deficits in psychotic disorders creates a window into brain function across the lifespan
- While psychotic symptoms typically emerge between ages 18-25, cognitive deficits are observed much earlier on in the lifespan of those who go on to develop schizophrenia. This suggests that cognitive deficits are a marker of abnormal neurodevelopment
- general consensus that children and adolescents exhibit premorbid cognitive impairments prior to the onset of schizophrenia
- The presence of psychosis in a first-degree relative increases the severity of childhood premorbid impairment in schizophrenia
- Children and adolescents who later develop schizophrenia show deficits in general cognitive abilities
- in addition to gen cog impairments, specific premorbid impairments exist in attention, memory, reasoning, and executive functioning, and some evidence includes processing speed
- premorbid cog deficits support the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, which posits the earliest signs of the disorder are mild abnormalities in cognitive development during the first two decades of life with deficits in the acquisition of cognitive abilities compared to normative individuals
- performance lag may begin as early as preschool age
- cognitive deficits exist prior to psychosis onset
- UHR/CHR/prodromal (although prodromal label can only be assinged after transition to psychosis) are identified through dimensions of attenuated psychotic symptoms and/or familial risk. approximately 13-23% of these indivdiuals convert to psychosis within two years
- there is reliable evidence that ultra-high risk individuals are globally cognitively impaired when compared to a normal sample
- at-risk participants demonstrate deficits in working memory, executive function, verbal fluency, attention, and memory
- individuals who endorse psychotic symptoms between ages 8-12 have a significantly lower predicted age based on their cognitive performance. This impairment is present at 8 years old, becomes even more pronounced after age 16, and is observed in all tested domains (executive function, memory, complex cognition, social cognition, and senorimotor) with the biggest lag in complex cognition, which includes verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, and spatial processing, and social cognition [Gur et al., 2014]
- UHR impairment is far less than impairment following first psychotic episode. UHR demonstrate impairments intermediate between healthy controls and first-episode idnviduals
- CHR individauls have been found to have perceptual processing abnormalities--difficulties with visual form perception and perceptual organization
- Sum.: prodromal psychosis is characterized by global cognitive impairment, with some specific risk associated with poor memory and attention during this stage. Individuals with a strong familial risk, more pronounced attenuated psychosis, and those who will ultimately convert to a psychotic disorder, demonstrate the greatest impairment in cognition on average.
