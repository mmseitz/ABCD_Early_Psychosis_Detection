### Family History and mean PQ-BC endorsement and distress correlations

(Karcher et al., 2018)
- Family history of psychotic disorder in first degree relatives was associated with higher mean PQ-BC total and distress, whereas a family history of depression or mania was not
- Higher PQ-BC scores were associated with neuropsychological test performance deficits such as working memory, motor and speech developmental milestone delays (particularly motor and speech devleopment) as well as KSADS internalizing composite
- PLE persistence over time is associated with greater odds of developing a psychotic disorder in adulthood
- PQ-BC analysis demonstrated measurement invariability across race/ethnicity and sex
- Family history of psychotic disorder was associated with higher mean PQ-BC total (3.883) and distress (10.210) scores
- Higher PQ-BC scores were associated with higher rates of child-rated internalizing symptoms

(Karcher et al., 2021)
- Brain volume associated with environmmental risk factors and PLEs
- PLEs associated with urbanicity, deprivation, and toxins
- Parental PLEs measured in Achenbach Self Report
- study examined (parcellated cortical and subcortical Desikan regions) intracranial volume, total cortical brain volume, total subcortical gray matter volume, total surface area, total cortical thickness, and hippocampal volume due to the wealth of research linking hippocampal volume to both environmental risk factors and PLEs
- Associations between PLEs and environmental risk factors: greater total drug offense exposure and less perception of neighborhood safety were associated with greater PLEs; greater deprivation and fewer years in current residence were associated with greater PLEs; lead exposure was the only environmental toxin associated with greater PLEs
- Each of the structural MRI variables (except hippocampal volume) were signifiicantly associated with PLEs. These structural MRI variables were also associated with all of the environmental risk factors that were significantly associated with PLEs including neighborhood safety, all deprivation indices, and lead exposure risk
- some evidence consistent with brain volume partially mediating the association between deprivation (both rate of poverty and overall deprivation), perceptions of neighborhood safety, and lead exposure risk with PLEs

(Leowy et al., 2011)
- Study examining validity of PQ-B in 141 adolescents and young adults
- participants completed both PQ-B and SIPS at intake
- Endorsement of *three or more* positive symptoms on the PQ-B differentiated between those with prodromal syndrome and psychotic syndrome diagnoses on the SIPS versus those with no SIPS diagnoses with 89% sensitivity, 58% specificity, and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.12
- A distress score measuring distress or impairment associated with endorsed positive symptoms increased the specificity to 68%, while retaining similar sensitivity of 88%
- agreement was very similar when participants with psychotic syndromes were excluded from the anlayses
- In a sample of young people referred to a prodromal psychosis research clinic, the PQ showed moderate concurrent validity with SIPS diagnoses, with 90% sensitivity and 49% specificity
- PQ-B focuses only on positive symptom items, as those are the basis for interview-based diagnoses of symptomatic prodromal syndromes. Additionally assessed frequency of each experience and presence of related distress or impairment
- In the general population, psychotic-like experiences can be present in up to 20% of adults, often in the absence of a full psychotic disorder
- In (Hanssen, et al, 2003) risk for later psychotic disorder was four to five times greater when individuals were distressed by the psychotic experience compared to those who were not. Undergraduate students endorsed PQ items at very high rates in (Leowy, et al 2007), but fewer endorsed items as distressing or impairing
- PQ-B is intended to capture symptomatic, at-risk syndromes and was developed from the 92 item Prodromal Questionnaire 
- Kruskal-Wallis test is a non parametric rank test that was used to compare PQ-B scores across the three SIPS diagnostic groups (no SIPS diagnosis, prodromal syndrome, and psychotic syndrome)
- Distress scores with a cutoff of 6+ showed greatest specificity (68%) while maintianing high sensitivity (88%). Its performance was very similar when fully psychotic patients were excluded from the analysis
- This instrument is designed to function as the first step in a two-stage screening process that relies on clinician interview to obtain a diagnosis. Therefore, PQ-B users should be careful not to equate a high score with prodromal psychosis or unavoidable development of schizophrenia

### Cognition and Psychosis

(Sheffield et al., 2018)
- not a sympotm of psychotic disorders, but cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of illnesses that include psychotic symptoms
- cognitive impairment is a main contributor to impairment in psychotic disorders
- understanding the timing, specificity, and severity of cognitive deficits in psychotic disorders creates a window into brain function across the lifespan
- While psychotic symptoms typically emerge between ages 18-25, cognitive deficits are observed much earlier on in the lifespan of those who go on to develop schizophrenia. This suggests that cognitive deficits are a marker of abnormal neurodevelopment
- general consensus that children and adolescents exhibit premorbid cognitive impairments prior to the onset of schizophrenia
- The presence of psychosis in a first-degree relative increases the severity of childhood premorbid impairment in schizophrenia
- Children and adolescents who later develop schizophrenia show deficits in general cognitive abilities
- in addition to gen cog impairments, specific premorbid impairments exist in attention, memory, reasoning, and executive functioning, and some evidence includes processing speed
- premorbid cog deficits support the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, which posits the earliest signs of the disorder are mild abnormalities in cognitive development during the first two decades of life with deficits in the acquisition of cognitive abilities compared to normative individuals
- performance lag may begin as early as preschool age
- cognitive deficits exist prior to psychosis onset
- UHR/CHR/prodromal (although prodromal label can only be assinged after transition to psychosis) are identified through dimensions of attenuated psychotic symptoms and/or familial risk. approximately 13-23% of these indivdiuals convert to psychosis within two years
- there is reliable evidence that ultra-high risk individuals are globally cognitively impaired when compared to a normal sample
- at-risk participants demonstrate deficits in working memory, executive function, verbal fluency, attention, and memory
- individuals who endorse psychotic symptoms between ages 8-12 have a significantly lower predicted age based on their cognitive performance. This impairment is present at 8 years old, becomes even more pronounced after age 16, and is observed in all tested domains (executive function, memory, complex cognition, social cognition, and senorimotor) with the biggest lag in complex cognition, which includes verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, and spatial processing, and social cognition [Gur et al., 2014]
- UHR impairment is far less than impairment following first psychotic episode. UHR demonstrate impairments intermediate between healthy controls and first-episode idnviduals
- CHR individauls have been found to have perceptual processing abnormalities--difficulties with visual form perception and perceptual organization
- Sum.: prodromal psychosis is characterized by global cognitive impairment, with some specific risk associated with poor memory and attention during this stage. Individuals with a strong familial risk, more pronounced attenuated psychosis, and those who will ultimately convert to a psychotic disorder, demonstrate the greatest impairment in cognition on average.

### Structural Brain Abnormalities in Psychosis-Risk Children

(Satterthwaite et al., 2016)
- population ranged in age from 8-22yrs (PS n = 391, TD n = 400)
- compared to the TD group, the PS group had diminished whole brain gray matter volume and expanded white matter volume
- Voxelwise analyses revealed significantly lower gray matter volume in the medial temporal lobes as well as in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. Reduction of medial temporal lobe volume was correlated with PS symptom severity
- Structural brain abnormalities that have been commonly reported in adults with psychosis are present early in life in youth with PS symptoms, and are not due to medication effects
- These differences can be used in conjunction with other risk measures to predict psychosis risk
- Psychosis is increasingly conceptualized as a downstream product of abnormal neurodevelopment
- The ENIGMA-SZ consortium examined subcortical volumes from a sample totaling over 2,000 patients with schizophrenia, and found reduced volume that was maximal in the hippocampus
- The NAPLS consortium demonstrated that clinical high risk youth who later convert to psychosis have accelerated gray matter loss in frontal cortex compared to non-converters adn healthy comparators
- It is increasingly recognized that subtle psychosis-spectrum symptoms are prevalent (5-10%) in the general population--these symtpoms can impact functioning, are associated with increased risk of conversion to a psychotic disorder, and have been associated wih neuroimaging abnormalities
- PS youths had reduced intra-cranial volume (ICV) compared to TD youth
- PS youths had marked reductioins in total gray matter volume
- When accounting for diminished ICV, PS youth had greater white matter volume than TD comparators
- When examined on a lobar level while accounting for ICV, gray matter differences were widespread and most significant within frontal cortex
- Voxelwise analyses revealed significant clusters of reduced volume in PS youth in a network of regions including bilateral medial temporal lobe, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate. Reduced volume was also seen in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior parietal cortex. Peak deficits were found in the medial temporal lobe
- Greater severity of PS symptoms in participants was associated with volume reduction in bilateral medial temporal lobe
- Many of the regions impacted are part of the default mode network, a large-scale functional network that is critical for internally directed attention, theory of mind, social cognition, and memory
- Both functional and structural deficits of default mode regions have been widely documented in psychosis
- Early loss of gray matter is consistent with prior reports of 'accelerated aging' in schizophrenia

(Sheffield et al. 2017)
- More pronounced cortical gray matter loss has been detected in UHR individuals who later convert to psychosis relative to health control and relative to non-converters
- Neuroimaging studies provide consistent evidence for greater gray matter decline over time in at-risk individuals who go on to develop the full-blown disorder relative to those who don't
- Structural brain abnormalities in psychosis occur prior to full-blown symptoms and progressively worsen as psychosis develops

### Youth Psychosis Risk
(Calkins et al., 2014)
- There are much higher rates of PLEs in youths than adults (range 5-35%). Although these symptoms are likely transient in most children, their evolution into full psychosis may be moderated by symptom severity, type, and persistence
- Regardless of eventual psychosis, early subclinical psychotic symptoms are associated with comorbid psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, and substance use; impaired global functioning and increased suicidality
- Psychosis spectrum youths showed a mild but significant decrease in performance accuracy across neurocognitive domains compared to non-spectrum
- Psychosis spectrum was significantly predicted by mania, depression, specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, oppositional defiant, and attention deficit/hyperactivity domains. Moreover, a third of psychosis spectrum youths endorsed passive thoughts of death and dying, more than 20% endorsed suicidal ideation, and both were significant predictors of psychosis spectrum group membership
- Among physically healthy young people, 12.3% reported positive sub-psychotic symptoms. *The most discriminating and widely endorsed attenuated positive symptoms were unusual thoughts and auditory perceptions, as observed in other populations*
- An additional 3.7% of participants (20.2% of psychosis spectrum participants) reported threshold psychotic symptoms
- Gender differences in psychotic-like experiences have varied in population studies. In our sample, being male was significantly predictive of psychosis spectrum, possibly reflecting earlier onset of clinically significant psychotic symptoms in males
- The psychosis spectrum group was disproportionately non-European American, and ethnicity was a significant predictor of spectrum status, consistent with prior studies of ethnic minority
- Although caregivers of psychosis spectrum youths reported higher levels of sub-psychotic symptoms than caregivers of non-spectrum youths, they substantially under-reported symptoms compared to their children
- several studies suggest that adolescents tend not to confide psychotic like experiences to their caregivers or clinicians

### ABCD
(Karcher et al., 2020)
- ABCD is the largest study in the US assessing brain development (baseline n = 11,875)
- The dataset has a wealth of measured attributes of youths and their environment, including neuroimaging, cognitive, biospecimen, behavioral, youth self-report and parent self-report metrics, and environmental measures
- ABCD utilized a school-based national recruitment strategy with limited exclusion criteria, helping to overcome challenges to previous general population studies that generally did not include neuroimaging as well as attempts to understand the risk factors associated with negative outcomes that relied on convenience samples
- ABCD has 21 nationally distributed data collection sites
- ABCD study assessments encompass seven domains: substance use, mental health, physical health and biospecimens, neurocognition, gender identity and sexual health, culture and environment, and brain imaging
