### Family History and mean PQ-BC endorsement and distress correlations

(Karcher et al., 2018)

- Family history of psychotic disorder in first degree relatives was associated with higher mean PQ-BC total and distress, whereas a family history of depression or mania was not
- Higher PQ-BC scores were associated with neuropsychological test performance deficits such as working memory, motor and speech developmental milestone delays (particularly motor and speech devleopment) as well as KSADS internalizing composite
- PLE persistence over time is associated with greater odds of developing a psychotic disorder in adulthood
- PQ-BC analysis demonstrated measurement invariability across race/ethnicity and sex
- Family history of psychotic disorder was associated with higher mean PQ-BC total (3.883) and distress (10.210) scores
- Higher PQ-BC scores were associated with higher rates of child-rated internalizing symptoms

(Karcher et al., 2021)

- Brain volume associated with environmmental risk factors and PLEs
- PLEs associated with urbanicity, deprivation, and toxins
- Parental PLEs measured in Achenbach Self Report
- study examined (parcellated cortical and subcortical Desikan regions) intracranial volume, total cortical brain volume, total subcortical gray matter volume, total surface area, total cortical thickness, and hippocampal volume due to the wealth of research linking hippocampal volume to both environmental risk factors and PLEs
- Associations between PLEs and environmental risk factors: greater total drug offense exposure and less perception of neighborhood safety were associated with greater PLEs; greater deprivation and fewer years in current residence were associated with greater PLEs; lead exposure was the only environmental toxin associated with greater PLEs
- Each of the structural MRI variables (except hippocampal volume) were signifiicantly associated with PLEs. These structural MRI variables were also associated with all of the environmental risk factors that were significantly associated with PLEs including neighborhood safety, all deprivation indices, and lead exposure risk
- some evidence consistent with brain volume partially mediating the association between deprivation (both rate of poverty and overall deprivation), perceptions of neighborhood safety, and lead exposure risk with PLEs

(Leowy et al., 2011)

- Study examining validity of PQ-B in 141 adolescents and young adults
- participants completed both PQ-B and SIPS at intake
- Endorsement of *three or more* positive symptoms on the PQ-B differentiated between those with prodromal syndrome and psychotic syndrome diagnoses on the SIPS versus those with no SIPS diagnoses with 89% sensitivity, 58% specificity, and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.12
- A distress score measuring distress or impairment associated with endorsed positive symptoms increased the specificity to 68%, while retaining similar sensitivity of 88%
- agreement was very similar when participants with psychotic syndromes were excluded from the anlayses
- In a sample of young people referred to a prodromal psychosis research clinic, the PQ showed moderate concurrent validity with SIPS diagnoses, with 90% sensitivity and 49% specificity
- PQ-B focuses only on positive symptom items, as those are the basis for interview-based diagnoses of symptomatic prodromal syndromes. Additionally assessed frequency of each experience and presence of related distress or impairment
- In the general population, psychotic-like experiences can be present in up to 20% of adults, often in the absence of a full psychotic disorder
- In (Hanssen, et al, 2003) risk for later psychotic disorder was four to five times greater when individuals were distressed by the psychotic experience compared to those who were not. Undergraduate students endorsed PQ items at very high rates in (Leowy, et al 2007), but fewer endorsed items as distressing or impairing
- PQ-B is intended to capture symptomatic, at-risk syndromes and was developed from the 92 item Prodromal Questionnaire 
- Kruskal-Wallis test is a non parametric rank test that was used to compare PQ-B scores across the three SIPS diagnostic groups (no SIPS diagnosis, prodromal syndrome, and psychotic syndrome)
- Distress scores with a cutoff of 6+ showed greatest specificity (68%) while maintianing high sensitivity (88%). Its performance was very similar when fully psychotic patients were excluded from the analysis
- This instrument is designed to function as the first step in a two-stage screening process that relies on clinician interview to obtain a diagnosis. Therefore, PQ-B users should be careful not to equate a high score with prodromal psychosis or unavoidable development of schizophrenia

### Cognition and Psychosis

(Sheffield et al., 2018)

- not a sympotm of psychotic disorders, but cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of illnesses that include psychotic symptoms
- cognitive impairment is a main contributor to impairment in psychotic disorders
- understanding the timing, specificity, and severity of cognitive deficits in psychotic disorders creates a window into brain function across the lifespan
- While psychotic symptoms typically emerge between ages 18-25, cognitive deficits are observed much earlier on in the lifespan of those who go on to develop schizophrenia. This suggests that cognitive deficits are a marker of abnormal neurodevelopment
- general consensus that children and adolescents exhibit premorbid cognitive impairments prior to the onset of schizophrenia
- The presence of psychosis in a first-degree relative increases the severity of childhood premorbid impairment in schizophrenia
- Children and adolescents who later develop schizophrenia show deficits in general cognitive abilities
- in addition to gen cog impairments, specific premorbid impairments exist in attention, memory, reasoning, and executive functioning, and some evidence includes processing speed
- premorbid cog deficits support the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, which posits the earliest signs of the disorder are mild abnormalities in cognitive development during the first two decades of life with deficits in the acquisition of cognitive abilities compared to normative individuals
- performance lag may begin as early as preschool age
- cognitive deficits exist prior to psychosis onset
- UHR/CHR/prodromal (although prodromal label can only be assinged after transition to psychosis) are identified through dimensions of attenuated psychotic symptoms and/or familial risk. approximately 13-23% of these indivdiuals convert to psychosis within two years
- there is reliable evidence that ultra-high risk individuals are globally cognitively impaired when compared to a normal sample
- at-risk participants demonstrate deficits in working memory, executive function, verbal fluency, attention, and memory
- individuals who endorse psychotic symptoms between ages 8-12 have a significantly lower predicted age based on their cognitive performance. This impairment is present at 8 years old, becomes even more pronounced after age 16, and is observed in all tested domains (executive function, memory, complex cognition, social cognition, and senorimotor) with the biggest lag in complex cognition, which includes verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, and spatial processing, and social cognition [Gur et al., 2014]
- UHR impairment is far less than impairment following first psychotic episode. UHR demonstrate impairments intermediate between healthy controls and first-episode idnviduals
- CHR individauls have been found to have perceptual processing abnormalities--difficulties with visual form perception and perceptual organization
- Sum.: prodromal psychosis is characterized by global cognitive impairment, with some specific risk associated with poor memory and attention during this stage. Individuals with a strong familial risk, more pronounced attenuated psychosis, and those who will ultimately convert to a psychotic disorder, demonstrate the greatest impairment in cognition on average.

### Structural Brain Abnormalities in Psychosis-Risk Children

(Satterthwaite et al., 2016)

- population ranged in age from 8-22yrs (PS n = 391, TD n = 400)
- compared to the TD group, the PS group had diminished whole brain gray matter volume and expanded white matter volume
- Voxelwise analyses revealed significantly lower gray matter volume in the medial temporal lobes as well as in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. Reduction of medial temporal lobe volume was correlated with PS symptom severity
- Structural brain abnormalities that have been commonly reported in adults with psychosis are present early in life in youth with PS symptoms, and are not due to medication effects
- These differences can be used in conjunction with other risk measures to predict psychosis risk
- Psychosis is increasingly conceptualized as a downstream product of abnormal neurodevelopment
- The ENIGMA-SZ consortium examined subcortical volumes from a sample totaling over 2,000 patients with schizophrenia, and found reduced volume that was maximal in the hippocampus
- The NAPLS consortium demonstrated that clinical high risk youth who later convert to psychosis have accelerated gray matter loss in frontal cortex compared to non-converters adn healthy comparators
- It is increasingly recognized that subtle psychosis-spectrum symptoms are prevalent (5-10%) in the general population--these symtpoms can impact functioning, are associated with increased risk of conversion to a psychotic disorder, and have been associated wih neuroimaging abnormalities
- PS youths had reduced intra-cranial volume (ICV) compared to TD youth
- PS youths had marked reductioins in total gray matter volume
- When accounting for diminished ICV, PS youth had greater white matter volume than TD comparators
- When examined on a lobar level while accounting for ICV, gray matter differences were widespread and most significant within frontal cortex
- Voxelwise analyses revealed significant clusters of reduced volume in PS youth in a network of regions including bilateral medial temporal lobe, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate. Reduced volume was also seen in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior parietal cortex. Peak deficits were found in the medial temporal lobe
- Greater severity of PS symptoms in participants was associated with volume reduction in bilateral medial temporal lobe
- Many of the regions impacted are part of the default mode network, a large-scale functional network that is critical for internally directed attention, theory of mind, social cognition, and memory
- Both functional and structural deficits of default mode regions have been widely documented in psychosis
- Early loss of gray matter is consistent with prior reports of 'accelerated aging' in schizophrenia

(Sheffield et al. 2017)

- More pronounced cortical gray matter loss has been detected in UHR individuals who later convert to psychosis relative to health control and relative to non-converters
- Neuroimaging studies provide consistent evidence for greater gray matter decline over time in at-risk individuals who go on to develop the full-blown disorder relative to those who don't
- Structural brain abnormalities in psychosis occur prior to full-blown symptoms and progressively worsen as psychosis develops

### Youth Psychosis Risk

(Calkins et al., 2014)

- There are much higher rates of PLEs in youths than adults (range 5-35%). Although these symptoms are likely transient in most children, their evolution into full psychosis may be moderated by symptom severity, type, and persistence
- Regardless of eventual psychosis, early subclinical psychotic symptoms are associated with comorbid psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, and substance use; impaired global functioning and increased suicidality
- Psychosis spectrum youths showed a mild but significant decrease in performance accuracy across neurocognitive domains compared to non-spectrum
- Psychosis spectrum was significantly predicted by mania, depression, specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, oppositional defiant, and attention deficit/hyperactivity domains. Moreover, a third of psychosis spectrum youths endorsed passive thoughts of death and dying, more than 20% endorsed suicidal ideation, and both were significant predictors of psychosis spectrum group membership
- Among physically healthy young people, 12.3% reported positive sub-psychotic symptoms. *The most discriminating and widely endorsed attenuated positive symptoms were unusual thoughts and auditory perceptions, as observed in other populations*
- An additional 3.7% of participants (20.2% of psychosis spectrum participants) reported threshold psychotic symptoms
- Gender differences in psychotic-like experiences have varied in population studies. In our sample, being male was significantly predictive of psychosis spectrum, possibly reflecting earlier onset of clinically significant psychotic symptoms in males
- The psychosis spectrum group was disproportionately non-European American, and ethnicity was a significant predictor of spectrum status, consistent with prior studies of ethnic minority
- Although caregivers of psychosis spectrum youths reported higher levels of sub-psychotic symptoms than caregivers of non-spectrum youths, they substantially under-reported symptoms compared to their children
- several studies suggest that adolescents tend not to confide psychotic like experiences to their caregivers or clinicians

### ABCD

(Karcher et al., 2020)

- ABCD is the largest study in the US assessing brain development (baseline n = 11,875)
- The dataset has a wealth of measured attributes of youths and their environment, including neuroimaging, cognitive, biospecimen, behavioral, youth self-report and parent self-report metrics, and environmental measures
- ABCD utilized a school-based national recruitment strategy with limited exclusion criteria, helping to overcome challenges to previous general population studies that generally did not include neuroimaging as well as attempts to understand the risk factors associated with negative outcomes that relied on convenience samples
- ABCD has 21 nationally distributed data collection sites
- ABCD study assessments encompass seven domains: substance use, mental health, physical health and biospecimens, neurocognition, gender identity and sexual health, culture and environment, and brain imaging

### ABCD and Psychosis Risk

(Karcher et al., 2024)

- Psychotic Like Experiences (PLEs) Include unusual thought content, including unconventional beliefs, and perceptual abnormalities, including auditory and visual distortions, that like on the lower end of the psychosis spectrum continuum
    - Although PLEs generally refer to non-clinical forms of psychosis spectrum symptoms, individuals experiencing PLEs in childhood and adolescence show greater odds of developing diagnosable health concerns, including psychosis, in adulthood
- According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment model (PPI model), most PLEs may be more benign and transient because exposure to additional environmental risks and/or stronger genetic/early environmental diathesis (potentially reflected in increased expression of pathophysiology over development) is necessary for subclinical psychosis to first become distressing and persistent and, second, to deteriorate into a clinical psychotic state
- Risk factors associated with early PLEs include family history of psychosis, delayed developmental milestones, early cognitive deficits, structural and functional neural impairments, internalizing symptoms, ACEs
- Unclear which risk factors are the most important markers of clinically significant PLEs—paper uses ML approach--aims to capture multivariate patterns of risk factors for early PLEs
- this study aimed to use random forest classifications to examine the most important predictors of distress and persistence of PLEs measured over three time points when examining a range of multi-modal predictors measured at baseline, with predictors spanning caregiver- and self-report symptoms and experiences, neural metrics, and neurocognition
- study uses baseline, follow up 1, and follow up 2 data
- Measures used: PQ-BC, KSADS, caregiver reported developmental motor and speech milestone delays, ACE, NIH Toolbox, structural MRI measures (average prefrontal cortical thickness), resting state functional connectivity
- Dichotomous distress factor was coded as one for individuals with >= 1.96 SDs above the mean of stress scores on the PQ-BC, with all other scores coded as zero
- Dichotomous persistence factor was coded as one if individuals met the above definition of distressing PLEs for two or more of the three waves of data
- low level PLE group matched by age, ethnicity, and sex
- ML techniques are becoming more widespread in psychiatric research. Random forest regressions are well suited for psychiatric research in large scale datasets, as this technique can handle the inclusion of many predictors simultaneously and is robust in its predictive accuracy even for many predictors with small effects
- Distinguishing persistent distressing versus low level PLEs: influential predictors included ACEs, internalizing symptoms, and fluid and crystalized cognition composites (also model with highest accuracy)
- Highest model accuracy was found if constraining the persistent distressing group to those that met criteria at all three waves
- Regardless of PLE group definition, the most important factors distinguishing higher PLE groups from lower PLE groups were internalizing symptoms and ACEs, with some evidence for cognitive factors showing greater importance relative to other factors
- PLEs are a heterogenous construct, with only a subset at risk for the development of a psychosis spectrum illness, although others developing other mental health conditions
- The results point to the importance of including factors that increase the clinical relevance of these endorsements, including persistence over time, when examining PLEs in large general population samples
- Analyses from the present work showed few metrics consistently distinguishing persistent distressing from other PLE groups, but these metrics included ACEs, highlighting the importance of stressful life events
- Previous research indicates that traumatic life events may be an important predictor of worsening psychotic symptoms, including up to 80% of individuals at high risk for psychosis endorsing a traumatic event in childhood
- The overall results may point to the heterogeneity of PLEs, with this heterogeneity perhaps masking the ability to uncover unifying risk factors. The heterogeneity of transient PLEs is highlighted by the poor accuracy of these groups regardless of how defined. Therefore, it may not be until the worsening of symptoms or onset of functional impairment that symptoms are of sufficient severity to be distinguished from less severe PLEs
- Analyses indicate that ML analyses can be used to distinguish persistent distressing from low level PLE groups. Additional evidence indicated that distress may be more distinguishable than persistence, including evidence that models performed poorly when trying to distinguish persistent from transient distressing PLEs
- The work also reinforces the importance of several metrics that have been previously implicated in the development and worsening of early psychotic experiences. ACEs appeared especially important for persistent distressing PLEs, potentially providing support for the PPI model—that worsening PLEs is linked to greater environmental loading. Both persistent and transient distressing PLEs were linked to risk factors including internalizing symptoms. 

### Childhood Stress and Psychosis Risk

(De Loore et al., 2007)

- experienced trauma and victimization during childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing subclinical or clinical psychosis symptoms in adulthood
- Experiences of victimization, such as bullying, and negative life events, may impact the onset and persistence of psychotic experiences in adults
- The effects are more visible for more unexpected and/or severe forms of trauma such as life events and sexual abuse, rather than more repeated and contextspecific traumas such as bullying
- The accumulation of negative life events appeared to amplify the risk to develop subclinical psychotic experiences in a dose–response fashion
- Severe and persistent traumatic events in childhood may lead to long-lasting neurodevelopmental and neurobiological abnormalities, reflecting a biological vulnerability for schizophrenia in adulthood, which has been demonstrated in a recent biological model
- stressful life events have been found to influence the course and intensity of psychotic symptoms, by inducing dopaminergic hyper-responsivity in response to mild stressors

(Bhavsar et al., 2017)

- It is well documented that early adversity increases likelihood of subsequent adversity, possibly through social processes whereby the negative effects of early adversity persist over time, restricting subsequent opportunities and increases likelihood of poverty and exposure to adverse events
- Childhood adversity and life events may both combine synergistically to increase risk (through effects on similar biological and psychological mechanisms) and be on a causal path, such that some of effect of childhood adversity on psychosis is mediated through increased likelihood (due to social processes) of subsequent adverse life events
- Associations were found between PEs and reporting childhood abuse, younger age, lower overall educational attainment, non-White ethnicity, being unemployed, and recent attack, crime victimisation, war exposure, witnessing of violence, experience of an accident, death of a partner and separation
- In the fully adjusted model, an estimated 47% of the total effect of abuse on PEs was mediated via adulthood adverse life events, of which violent life events made up 33% and non-violent life events the remaining 14%. The overall association between childhood abuse and PEs was explained partially by indirect effects via the experience both of adulthood violent and non-violent adverse life events.
- The relationship between trauma, psychosis and other trauma-related psychopathology is likely to be complex
