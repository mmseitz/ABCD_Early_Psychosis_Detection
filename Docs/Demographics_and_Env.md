# High- and Low-Risk Group Differences in Demographics and Environment

In order to provide some context to participant Prodromal Psychosis Scores and cognitive task performance, we examined differences between groups within an abridged collection of demographic and environmental data. 

CSVs used: pdem02 (demographics) and abcd_mhy02 (mental health summary scores--youth surveys)

### Demographics
Within demographics, we examine highest level of parental education, household income, participant race, and participant assigned sex at birth

Income has been simplified into three categories: Lower, Middle, and Higher Income. Annual household income below $35K is considered lower income, between $35K and $100K is middle income, and above $100K is considered higher income. (numerically coded: lower = 1, middle = 2, higher = 3)

Race has been simplified into four categories: White, Black, Hispanic, and Other (numerically coded: White = 1, Black = 2, Hispanic = 3, Other = 4)

Highest level of parental education has been simplified into three categories: High School Education (meaning that the parents completed high school or less), college (meaning that the parents completed some or all of college, but not beyond a bachelor's degree), post-grad (meaning that the parents completed at least some education beyond a bachelor's degree). (numerically coded: high school = 1, college = 2, post grad = 3)

Sex (as assigned at birth) has been coded as male = 1, female = 2, other = 3
